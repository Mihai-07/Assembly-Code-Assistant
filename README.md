# LLM-Powered Assembly Assistant

Welcome to the **LLM-Powered Assembly Documentation Tool**! This project is an interactive, AI-powered assistant designed to help you explore and understand the Assembly programming language, with a focus on x86 Assembly. The assistant leverages large language models and a vector database of Assembly documentation to provide context-aware answers to your questions.

## Features

- **Conversational Q&A:** Ask any question about Assembly programming and get AI-generated answers, with context retrieved from a local documentation database.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Uses a FAISS vector store and sentence-transformer embeddings to find the most relevant documentation snippets for your query.
- **Streamlit UI:** Simple, interactive web interface for asking questions and viewing responses.
- **Transparency:** All AI-generated answers are flagged as potentially inaccurate, encouraging critical evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Home.py**  
  The entry point of the app. Displays a welcoming animated title and introduction, and guides users to the Demo or About pages.

- **pages/Demo.py**  
  The core of the assistant. This page provides the interactive Q&A interface:
  - Accepts user questions about Assembly.
  - Retrieves relevant documentation from a local FAISS vector store (`x86-asm-docs/`).
  - Uses a large language model (via OpenRouter and DeepSeek) to generate answers, streaming the response in real time.
  - Warns users that answers are AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies.

- **pages/About.py**  
  Displays the contents of this README, providing users with information about the project.

- **x86-asm-docs/**  
  Contains the FAISS vector store and related files for fast retrieval of Assembly documentation.

## Installation

You can install and run the project using **pip**, **conda**, or **uv**.  
**Python 3.11 or higher is required.**

### 1. Using pip

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (if requirements.txt exists)
# OR, using pyproject.toml (recommended for modern projects):
pip install .
streamlit run Home.py
```

### 2. Using conda

```bash
conda create -n assemblydocs python=3.11
conda activate assemblydocs
pip install .
streamlit run Home.py
```

### 3. Using uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager.

```bash
uv init .
uv add .
uv run streamlit run Home.py
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, start the app with:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

- Visit the "Demo" page to interact with the Assembly Assistant.
- Visit the "About" page for more information.

## API Keys

This project requires a DeepSeek API key for LLM access via OpenRouter.  
Set your API key in your Streamlit secrets as follows:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[api_keys]
deepseek = "YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
```
